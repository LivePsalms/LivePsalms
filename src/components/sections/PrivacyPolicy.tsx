      <h2>Our Privacy Commitment</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to LivePsalms. We provide a faith-based, interconnected note-taking platform
        designed for Christian devotional practices, sermon listening, and thematic Bible study. Our
        services include an optional AI-powered feature suite called "Lamplight" that helps you
        deepen your spiritual walk by generating personalized reflections and discovering meaningful
        connections between your notes.
      </p>
      <p>
        We believe that your spiritual journal is sacred. Your devotional notes, sermon reflections,
        prayer entries, and personal meditations are deeply intimate expressions of your faith. We
        built LivePsalms with a foundational principle: <strong>your notes are yours alone</strong>.
        We do not read, review, access, monitor, or analyze your personal notes for any purpose
        other than storing them securely on your behalf and delivering them back to you when you
        request them. No employee, administrator, contractor, or automated system at LivePsalms will
        ever open, browse, or inspect the content of your notes. The only exception to this
        principle is when you explicitly opt into our Lamplight AI feature, in which case your note
        content is processed exclusively by automated systems to generate personalized devotional
        content — and even then, no human being ever sees your notes.
      </p>
      <p>
        This Privacy Policy explains in detail how we collect, use, store, share, and protect your
        personal information, as well as your rights regarding your data under global regulations,
        including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) [1], the California Consumer
        Privacy Act as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (CCPA/CPRA) [2], the European
        Union Artificial Intelligence Act (EU AI Act) [3], and other applicable privacy laws
        worldwide.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Data Controller and Contact Information</h2>
      <p>
        LivePsalms is the data controller responsible for the processing of your personal data as
        described in this Privacy Policy. If you have any questions, concerns, or requests regarding
        your privacy, you may contact us at:

      <h2>2. Important Disclosures Regarding Sensitive Personal Data</h2>
      <p>
        Because LivePsalms is a faith-based platform, our processing of your notes, folder names,
        tags, and theological preferences inherently reveals information about your{' '}
        <strong>religious beliefs</strong>. Under the GDPR, religious beliefs are classified as
        "Special Category Data" under Article 9 [1]. Under the CCPA/CPRA, religious beliefs are
        classified as "Sensitive Personal Information" [2]. Under various other global privacy
        frameworks, similar heightened protections apply to data revealing religious convictions.
      </p>
      <p>
        We recognize the profound sensitivity of this data and treat it with the highest level of
        care. We process your religious data solely on the basis of your{' '}
        <strong>explicit consent</strong>, which you provide by:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Creating an account and voluntarily entering devotional content into the platform.
        </li>
        <li>
          Explicitly enabling the Lamplight AI feature through a dedicated toggle with a recorded
          consent timestamp.
        </li>
        <li>
          Selecting theological preferences such as your tradition hint (evangelical, catholic,
          orthodox, or unspecified) and voice preference.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        You may withdraw your consent at any time by deleting your notes, turning off the Lamplight
        AI feature, using the "Forget my Lamplight history" function, or permanently deleting your
        account. Withdrawal of consent does not affect the lawfulness of processing carried out
        prior to the withdrawal.
      </p>

      <hr />

      <h2>3. Information We Collect and How We Collect It</h2>
      <p>
        We collect several categories of information depending on how you interact with our
        platform. We adhere to the principle of <strong>data minimization</strong> — we only
        collect information that is strictly necessary to provide, maintain, and improve our
        services.

      <h2>4. The "Lamplight" AI Feature Suite — Detailed Disclosure</h2>

      <h3>4.1 Overview and Opt-In Nature</h3>
      <p>
        Lamplight is our optional, AI-powered devotional assistant. It is designed to help you
        discover deeper spiritual connections in your notes by generating personalized daily
        devotions, identifying thematic relationships between your notes, and suggesting relevant
        Bible passages.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Lamplight is entirely opt-in.</strong> It is disabled by default for all users. To
        activate Lamplight, you must explicitly toggle the "Lamplight on" switch in your Profile
        settings. When you enable Lamplight, we record a <code>consent_decided_at</code> timestamp
        to document your explicit, informed consent. You may disable Lamplight at any time, which
        immediately halts all AI processing of your new notes.
      </p>

      <h3>4.2 What Data Lamplight Processes</h3>
      <p>When Lamplight is enabled, the following automated processes occur:</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Embedding Generation</strong>: When you save or update a note, our system extracts
        the plaintext content of that note, splits it into manageable chunks, and sends those chunks
        to Voyage AI's embedding API to generate a mathematical vector representation (a
        1024-dimensional numerical array). This vector captures the semantic meaning of your text
        without retaining the original words. The vector is stored in our database alongside a
        cryptographic hash of the content (used to avoid redundant reprocessing).
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Daily Devotion Generation</strong>: When you request your "Today's Lamp" devotion,
        our system retrieves the plaintext of your 3 most recently updated notes (up to 800
        characters each), your first name (derived from your profile), your voice preference, and
        your tradition hint. This context is sent to Anthropic's Claude API, which generates a
        personalized devotional reflection grounded in your notes and relevant Bible passages.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Connection Card Generation</strong>: When our system identifies that two of your
        notes are semantically similar (based on their vector embeddings), it may generate a brief
        explanation of why those notes are connected. This involves sending the plaintext of both
        notes to Anthropic's Claude API to produce a short, human-readable explanation.
      </p>

      <h3>4.4 Automated Decision-Making and Profiling</h3>
      <p>
        Lamplight uses automated processing to generate content recommendations and identify note
        connections. However, these automated processes do <strong>not</strong> produce any
        decisions that have legal or similarly significant effects on you. The AI-generated content
        is purely informational and devotional in nature. You are never denied access to any
        feature, charged differently, or treated differently based on the outputs of our AI systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        Under GDPR Article 22, you have the right not to be subject to decisions based solely on
        automated processing that produce legal effects. Because our AI features do not produce such
        effects, Article 22 restrictions do not apply. Nevertheless, we provide full transparency
        about our automated processing and give you complete control to opt in, opt out, or delete
        all AI-generated data at any time.
      </p>

      <h3>4.5 AI-Generated Content Labeling</h3>
      <p>
        In compliance with the EU AI Act Article 50 [3], we clearly identify all AI-generated
        content within the LivePsalms interface. Daily devotions, connection card explanations, and
        verse suggestions generated by Lamplight are visually distinguished and labeled as
        AI-generated content so that you always know which content was written by you and which was
        produced by our AI systems.

      <h3>5.3 No Human Access to Your Notes</h3>
      <p>
        We want to reiterate and expand upon our core commitment:{' '}
        <strong>
          no human being — whether a LivePsalms employee, a sub-processor employee, a contractor,
          or any other person — will ever read, access, or review the content of your notes.
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        When your notes are processed by Lamplight, they are handled exclusively by automated
        machine learning systems. The AI models receive your text, generate a response, and the text
        passes through no human review pipeline. Anthropic's commercial API does not include human
        review of customer prompts or completions. Voyage AI's embedding service processes text
        mathematically without human inspection.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our database is protected by Row Level Security (RLS) policies enforced at the PostgreSQL
        level. These policies ensure that database queries — even those executed by our own backend
        services — can only return data belonging to the authenticated user making the request. Our
        administrative tools do not include any interface for browsing, searching, or reading
        individual user notes.
      </p>

      <hr />

      <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
      <p>
        We implement multiple layers of security to protect your personal information:
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Encryption in Transit</strong>: All data transmitted between your browser and our
        servers is encrypted using TLS 1.2 or higher (HTTPS). This includes your notes,
        authentication credentials, and all API communications with our sub-processors.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Encryption at Rest</strong>: Your data is stored on encrypted volumes within AWS
        data centers managed by Supabase. Database backups are also encrypted.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Row Level Security (RLS)</strong>: Every table in our database that contains user
        data is protected by PostgreSQL Row Level Security policies. These policies enforce that any
        query — whether from the application, an Edge Function, or an administrative tool — can
        only access rows belonging to the authenticated user. This is enforced at the database
        engine level, not merely at the application level, providing defense-in-depth.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Authentication Security</strong>: Passwords are hashed using industry-standard
        bcrypt algorithms before storage. We never store plaintext passwords. OAuth tokens from
        Google and Apple are handled by Supabase Auth and are never exposed to our application code.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>JWT Verification</strong>: All serverless Edge Functions (which power Lamplight)
        require valid JSON Web Token authentication. Requests without valid tokens are rejected
        before any data processing occurs.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Content Hashing for Deduplication</strong>: Before sending note content to AI
        services, our system computes a SHA-256 hash of the content. If the hash matches a
        previously processed version, the note is not re-sent to external services, minimizing
        unnecessary data exposure.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Service-Role Isolation</strong>: Backend operations that require elevated database
        privileges (such as processing embedding jobs) use isolated service-role credentials that
        are never exposed to client-side code.
      </p>

      <hr />

      <h2>7. International Data Transfers</h2>
      <p>
        LivePsalms is hosted on cloud infrastructure provided by Supabase, utilizing Amazon Web
        Services (AWS) data centers. Our primary infrastructure is located in the{' '}
        <strong>United States</strong> [4] [8].
      </p>
      <p>
        If you access our services from outside the United States — including from the European
        Economic Area (EEA), the United Kingdom (UK), Switzerland, or any other jurisdiction —
        your personal data will be transferred to and processed in the United States. We acknowledge
        that the United States may not provide the same level of data protection as your home
        jurisdiction.
      </p>
      <p>
        To ensure that your data receives adequate protection during these international transfers,
        we implement the following safeguards:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs)</strong>: We incorporate the European
          Commission's Standard Contractual Clauses into our agreements with sub-processors to
          provide appropriate safeguards for transfers of personal data from the EEA to the United
          States [4] [5].
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Data Processing Agreements (DPAs)</strong>: We maintain formal Data Processing
          Agreements with all sub-processors that define their obligations regarding data security,
          confidentiality, and compliance with applicable data protection laws.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Supplementary Measures</strong>: We implement technical measures (encryption,
          access controls, pseudonymization where feasible) to supplement the contractual safeguards
          and address any residual risks associated with international transfers.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>Our sub-processors' data processing locations are as follows:</p>

        <strong>Cascading Deletion</strong>: When you delete your account, our system executes a
        cascading deletion at the database level. Deleting your profile row automatically triggers
        the permanent deletion of all associated records: notes, folders, Lamplight settings,
        entitlements, embeddings, artifacts, jobs, suggestions logs, connections, and usage
        telemetry. This is enforced by foreign key constraints with{' '}
        <code>ON DELETE CASCADE</code> at the PostgreSQL level, ensuring no orphaned data remains.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Backup Retention</strong>: Database backups maintained by our infrastructure
        provider (Supabase) follow their standard retention schedule. Deleted data will be purged
        from backup systems within the backup rotation period (typically 7–30 days depending on the
        plan tier).

        LivePsalms does not track users across third-party websites and does not serve targeted

      <h2>11. Children's Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        LivePsalms is not directed at, marketed to, or intended for use by children under the age
        of 13 (or under the age of 16 in jurisdictions where the GDPR applies and the member state
        has not lowered the digital age of consent). We do not knowingly collect, solicit, or
        process personal information from children below these age thresholds.
      </p>
      <p>
        If we become aware that we have inadvertently collected personal data from a child without
        verifiable parental consent, we will take immediate steps to delete that information from
        our systems. If you are a parent or guardian and believe that your child has provided us
        with personal data without your consent, please contact us immediately at{' '}
        <a href="mailto:support@livepsalms.com">support@livepsalms.com</a>, and we will promptly
        investigate and remove the data.
      </p>
      <p>
        We do not use age verification mechanisms at registration. The optional "date of birth"
        field in the user profile is not used for age-gating purposes and is entirely voluntary.
      </p>

      <hr />

      <h2>12. Third-Party Links and Services</h2>
      <p>
        LivePsalms may contain links to third-party websites, services, or resources that are not
        operated by us. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that third
        party's site. We strongly advise you to review the privacy policy of every site you visit.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or
        practices of any third-party sites or services. Our inclusion of links to third-party
        resources does not imply endorsement of their privacy practices.

      <h2>13. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our data
        practices, the addition of new features, changes in applicable law, or updates to our
        sub-processor relationships. When we make changes:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>We will update the "Last Updated" date at the top of this document.</li>
        <li>
          For <strong>material changes</strong> — such as new categories of data collection, new
          sub-processors, or changes to how we use AI — we will provide prominent notice through one
          or more of the following methods:
          <ul>
            <li>A banner notification within the LivePsalms application.</li>
            <li>
              An email notification sent to the address associated with your account.
            </li>
            <li>A prominent announcement on our website.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Where required by law, we will obtain your renewed consent before implementing changes
          that affect the processing of your sensitive personal data.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically. Your continued use of
        LivePsalms after the effective date of any changes constitutes your acceptance of the
        updated policy, except where additional consent is required by law.
