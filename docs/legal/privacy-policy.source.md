# LivePsalms Privacy Policy

**Effective Date**: May 28, 2026
**Last Updated**: May 28, 2026

## Our Privacy Commitment

Welcome to LivePsalms. We provide a faith-based, interconnected note-taking platform designed for Christian devotional practices, sermon listening, and thematic Bible study. Our services include an optional AI-powered feature suite called "Lamplight" that helps you deepen your spiritual walk by generating personalized reflections and discovering meaningful connections between your notes.

We believe that your spiritual journal is sacred. Your devotional notes, sermon reflections, prayer entries, and personal meditations are deeply intimate expressions of your faith. We built LivePsalms with a foundational principle: **your notes are yours alone**. We do not read, review, access, monitor, or analyze your personal notes for any purpose other than storing them securely on your behalf and delivering them back to you when you request them. No employee, administrator, contractor, or automated system at LivePsalms will ever open, browse, or inspect the content of your notes. The only exception to this principle is when you explicitly opt into our Lamplight AI feature, in which case your note content is processed exclusively by automated systems to generate personalized devotional content — and even then, no human being ever sees your notes.

This Privacy Policy explains in detail how we collect, use, store, share, and protect your personal information, as well as your rights regarding your data under global regulations, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) [1], the California Consumer Privacy Act as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (CCPA/CPRA) [2], the European Union Artificial Intelligence Act (EU AI Act) [3], and other applicable privacy laws worldwide.

## 1. Data Controller and Contact Information

LivePsalms is the data controller responsible for the processing of your personal data as described in this Privacy Policy. If you have any questions, concerns, or requests regarding your privacy, you may contact us at:

- **Email**: support@livepsalms.com
- **Mailing Address**: LivePsalms Privacy Team, 17130 Van Buren Blvd, Unit 855, Riverside, CA 92504, USA

If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA) or the United Kingdom (UK) and wish to exercise your rights under applicable data protection laws, or if you have a complaint about how we handle your data, you may also contact your local Data Protection Authority (DPA).

---

## 2. Important Disclosures Regarding Sensitive Personal Data

Because LivePsalms is a faith-based platform, our processing of your notes, folder names, tags, and theological preferences inherently reveals information about your **religious beliefs**. Under the GDPR, religious beliefs are classified as "Special Category Data" under Article 9 [1]. Under the CCPA/CPRA, religious beliefs are classified as "Sensitive Personal Information" [2]. Under various other global privacy frameworks, similar heightened protections apply to data revealing religious convictions.

We recognize the profound sensitivity of this data and treat it with the highest level of care. We process your religious data solely on the basis of your **explicit consent**, which you provide by:

1. Creating an account and voluntarily entering devotional content into the platform.
2. Explicitly enabling the Lamplight AI feature through a dedicated toggle with a recorded consent timestamp.
3. Selecting theological preferences such as your tradition hint (evangelical, catholic, orthodox, or unspecified) and voice preference.

You may withdraw your consent at any time by deleting your notes, turning off the Lamplight AI feature, using the "Forget my Lamplight history" function, or permanently deleting your account. Withdrawal of consent does not affect the lawfulness of processing carried out prior to the withdrawal.

---

## 3. Information We Collect and How We Collect It

We collect several categories of information depending on how you interact with our platform. We adhere to the principle of **data minimization** — we only collect information that is strictly necessary to provide, maintain, and improve our services.

### 3.1 Personal Data Provided Directly by You

When you create an account, update your profile, or subscribe to our communications, you provide us with the following information:

| Category | Specific Fields | Purpose | Legal Basis (GDPR) | Required? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Account Credentials** | Email address, password (stored only as a secure bcrypt hash — we never store your plaintext password) | To create, authenticate, and secure your account; to send transactional emails such as email verification and password reset links. | Performance of contract | Yes |
| **Profile Information** | Full name | To personalize your experience and address you by name within the application and in AI-generated devotional content. | Performance of contract | Yes |
| **Optional Profile Fields** | Date of birth, profile picture (avatar image) | To allow you to personalize your profile. Date of birth is never used for age-based targeting or shared with third parties. | Consent | No |
| **Newsletter Subscription** | Email address, source tag (indicating where you signed up) | To send you periodic updates, product announcements, and faith-based content. You may unsubscribe at any time. | Consent | No |

### 3.2 User-Generated Content

Your notes and organizational structures constitute the core of your LivePsalms experience. This content is stored securely on our servers to ensure cross-device access and data persistence.

| Category | Specific Fields | Purpose | Legal Basis (GDPR) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Notes** | Title, rich-text content (stored as structured TipTap JSON), note type (devotion, sermon, or theme), user-defined tags, computed word count, creation and modification timestamps | To provide note-taking functionality, enable search, render your visual knowledge graph, and track your writing progress toward tier milestones. | Performance of contract / Explicit consent (religious content) |
| **Folders** | Folder name, hierarchical parent folder reference, display order, custom icon selection, custom color | To allow you to organize, categorize, and structure your notes in a way that reflects your personal study system. | Performance of contract |

> **Our Commitment**: We want to be unequivocally clear — **no one at LivePsalms will ever read, review, access, or inspect the content of your notes**. Your notes are encrypted in transit and stored in a database protected by Row Level Security (RLS), meaning that even at the database level, queries are restricted so that only your authenticated session can retrieve your own data. Our backend administrators do not have tooling or workflows that would allow them to browse individual user notes. Your spiritual reflections, prayers, and personal meditations remain entirely private.

### 3.3 Automatically Collected Technical Data

When you access LivePsalms, our infrastructure automatically processes limited technical information necessary to deliver the service securely.

| Category | Specific Fields | Purpose | Legal Basis (GDPR) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Authentication Tokens** | JSON Web Tokens (JWTs), session identifiers | To maintain your authenticated session across page loads and API requests. | Performance of contract |
| **Application State** | Session-level flags stored in browser `sessionStorage` (e.g., whether the introductory animation has played) | To manage user interface transitions and prevent repetitive animations within a single browsing session. | Legitimate interest |

We do **not** use third-party analytics services, advertising trackers, behavioral profiling tools, or fingerprinting technologies. We do not embed social media tracking pixels. We do not serve advertisements of any kind.

### 3.4 Data Stored Locally on Your Device

If you use LivePsalms without creating an account or before logging in, your data is stored entirely on your device using your browser's `localStorage` mechanism. This data never leaves your device and is never transmitted to our servers unless you explicitly choose to create an account and migrate your local data to the cloud.

| Storage Key | Data Stored | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `notepad_notes` | Complete JSON array of all your notes (titles, content, tags, timestamps) | To provide offline-capable note-taking before account creation. |
| `notepad_folders` | Complete JSON array of all your folder structures | To provide offline-capable folder organization before account creation. |

Upon account creation, you are offered the opportunity to migrate this local data to your secure cloud account. After successful migration, the local copies are cleared from your browser. You may also clear this local data at any time by using your browser's built-in storage management tools.

## 4. The "Lamplight" AI Feature Suite — Detailed Disclosure

### 4.1 Overview and Opt-In Nature

Lamplight is our optional, AI-powered devotional assistant. It is designed to help you discover deeper spiritual connections in your notes by generating personalized daily devotions, identifying thematic relationships between your notes, and suggesting relevant Bible passages.

**Lamplight is entirely opt-in.** It is disabled by default for all users. To activate Lamplight, you must explicitly toggle the "Lamplight on" switch in your Profile settings. When you enable Lamplight, we record a `consent_decided_at` timestamp to document your explicit, informed consent. You may disable Lamplight at any time, which immediately halts all AI processing of your new notes.

### 4.2 What Data Lamplight Processes

When Lamplight is enabled, the following automated processes occur:

**Embedding Generation**: When you save or update a note, our system extracts the plaintext content of that note, splits it into manageable chunks, and sends those chunks to Voyage AI's embedding API to generate a mathematical vector representation (a 1024-dimensional numerical array). This vector captures the semantic meaning of your text without retaining the original words. The vector is stored in our database alongside a cryptographic hash of the content (used to avoid redundant reprocessing).

**Daily Devotion Generation**: When you request your "Today's Lamp" devotion, our system retrieves the plaintext of your 3 most recently updated notes (up to 800 characters each), your first name (derived from your profile), your voice preference, and your tradition hint. This context is sent to Anthropic's Claude API, which generates a personalized devotional reflection grounded in your notes and relevant Bible passages.

**Connection Card Generation**: When our system identifies that two of your notes are semantically similar (based on their vector embeddings), it may generate a brief explanation of why those notes are connected. This involves sending the plaintext of both notes to Anthropic's Claude API to produce a short, human-readable explanation.

### 4.3 What Data Lamplight Stores

| Data Category | What Is Stored | Retention Period | Can You Delete It? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Settings** | Opt-in status, quiet mode, voice preference (Lord/Father/Abba/Jesus), tradition hint (evangelical/catholic/orthodox/unspecified), inline suggestions preference, weekly email preference, consent timestamp | Until you delete settings or your account | Yes — via "Forget my Lamplight history" |
| **Entitlements** | Your Lamplight tier (plus/lite/none), source (promo/subscription/grant), grant date, expiration date | Until your account is deleted | Yes — via account deletion |
| **Embeddings** | Source type (note or Bible passage), source ID, content hash, 1024-dimensional vector, metadata | Until you delete Lamplight history or your account | Yes — via "Forget my Lamplight history" |
| **Artifacts** | Generated devotion type, period key, title, body content, source note IDs, source Bible verses, AI model used, prompt version | Until you delete Lamplight history or your account | Yes — via "Forget my Lamplight history" |
| **Processing Jobs** | Job type, queue status, payload, attempt count, scheduling timestamps, error messages | Until you delete Lamplight history or your account | Yes — via "Forget my Lamplight history" |
| **Suggestions Log** | Note ID, Bible verse reference, explanation text, timestamp shown, user outcome (inserted/dismissed/ignored) | Until you delete Lamplight history or your account | Yes — via "Forget my Lamplight history" |
| **Connections** | Source note ID, related note ID, similarity score, explanation text, content hash | Until you delete Lamplight history or your account | Yes — via "Forget my Lamplight history" |
| **Usage Telemetry** | AI model name, artifact kind, input/output token counts, success/error status, error classification codes | Until your account is deleted | Yes — via account deletion |

### 4.4 Automated Decision-Making and Profiling

Lamplight uses automated processing to generate content recommendations and identify note connections. However, these automated processes do **not** produce any decisions that have legal or similarly significant effects on you. The AI-generated content is purely informational and devotional in nature. You are never denied access to any feature, charged differently, or treated differently based on the outputs of our AI systems.

Under GDPR Article 22, you have the right not to be subject to decisions based solely on automated processing that produce legal effects. Because our AI features do not produce such effects, Article 22 restrictions do not apply. Nevertheless, we provide full transparency about our automated processing and give you complete control to opt in, opt out, or delete all AI-generated data at any time.

### 4.5 AI-Generated Content Labeling

In compliance with the EU AI Act Article 50 [3], we clearly identify all AI-generated content within the LivePsalms interface. Daily devotions, connection card explanations, and verse suggestions generated by Lamplight are visually distinguished and labeled as AI-generated content so that you always know which content was written by you and which was produced by our AI systems.

## 5. How We Share Your Information — Sub-processors and Third Parties

### 5.1 Our No-Sale, No-Sharing Commitment

**We do not sell your personal information.** We do not share your personal information for cross-context behavioral advertising. We do not provide your data to data brokers, marketing networks, or any third party for their own independent use. We do not monetize your data in any way.

### 5.2 Sub-processors

To deliver our services, we engage a limited number of trusted technology partners who act as our data sub-processors. Each sub-processor is contractually bound to process your data only on our instructions and in accordance with applicable data protection laws.

| Sub-processor | Headquarters | Role | Data They Access | Training on Your Data? | Data Retention by Sub-processor |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Supabase, Inc.** | San Francisco, CA, USA | Cloud database hosting, user authentication (including OAuth flows), file storage for avatars, and serverless Edge Function execution. | All database records including profile data, notes, folders, and Lamplight tables. Hashed passwords. Avatar image files. | No | Data persists until you delete it or your account. Supabase does not independently retain copies beyond what is in the active database. |
| **Anthropic, PBC** | San Francisco, CA, USA | Large Language Model provider (Claude Haiku and Claude Sonnet). Used exclusively for generating devotional text and connection explanations within Lamplight. | Note plaintext (max 800 characters per note, max 3–5 notes per request), your first name, voice preference, and tradition hint. | **No.** Under Anthropic's commercial API terms, customer inputs and outputs are never used to train their models [7]. | Anthropic does not retain API inputs/outputs for commercial customers beyond the duration needed to process the request and provide safety monitoring. |
| **Voyage AI Innovations, Inc.** | San Francisco, CA, USA | Text embedding generation and passage reranking. Used to convert note text into semantic vectors and to match Bible passages to your themes. | Plaintext note content (chunked) and search query text. | **No** (on paid tier). Voyage AI's terms state that paid-tier customer content is deleted immediately after processing when the customer has opted out of training [6]. | Content is deleted immediately after embedding generation is complete. |
| **Google LLC** | Mountain View, CA, USA | OAuth identity provider (Sign in with Google). | Your Google account email, display name, and profile picture — only when you choose to sign in with Google. | N/A | Governed by Google's own Privacy Policy. |
| **Apple Inc.** | Cupertino, CA, USA | OAuth identity provider (Sign in with Apple). | Your Apple ID email (or relay email if you choose to hide your email), and display name — only when you choose to sign in with Apple. | N/A | Governed by Apple's own Privacy Policy. |

### 5.3 No Human Access to Your Notes

We want to reiterate and expand upon our core commitment: **no human being — whether a LivePsalms employee, a sub-processor employee, a contractor, or any other person — will ever read, access, or review the content of your notes.**

When your notes are processed by Lamplight, they are handled exclusively by automated machine learning systems. The AI models receive your text, generate a response, and the text passes through no human review pipeline. Anthropic's commercial API does not include human review of customer prompts or completions. Voyage AI's embedding service processes text mathematically without human inspection.

Our database is protected by Row Level Security (RLS) policies enforced at the PostgreSQL level. These policies ensure that database queries — even those executed by our own backend services — can only return data belonging to the authenticated user making the request. Our administrative tools do not include any interface for browsing, searching, or reading individual user notes.

---

## 6. Data Security

We implement multiple layers of security to protect your personal information:

**Encryption in Transit**: All data transmitted between your browser and our servers is encrypted using TLS 1.2 or higher (HTTPS). This includes your notes, authentication credentials, and all API communications with our sub-processors.

**Encryption at Rest**: Your data is stored on encrypted volumes within AWS data centers managed by Supabase. Database backups are also encrypted.

**Row Level Security (RLS)**: Every table in our database that contains user data is protected by PostgreSQL Row Level Security policies. These policies enforce that any query — whether from the application, an Edge Function, or an administrative tool — can only access rows belonging to the authenticated user. This is enforced at the database engine level, not merely at the application level, providing defense-in-depth.

**Authentication Security**: Passwords are hashed using industry-standard bcrypt algorithms before storage. We never store plaintext passwords. OAuth tokens from Google and Apple are handled by Supabase Auth and are never exposed to our application code.

**JWT Verification**: All serverless Edge Functions (which power Lamplight) require valid JSON Web Token authentication. Requests without valid tokens are rejected before any data processing occurs.

**Content Hashing for Deduplication**: Before sending note content to AI services, our system computes a SHA-256 hash of the content. If the hash matches a previously processed version, the note is not re-sent to external services, minimizing unnecessary data exposure.

**Service-Role Isolation**: Backend operations that require elevated database privileges (such as processing embedding jobs) use isolated service-role credentials that are never exposed to client-side code.

---

## 7. International Data Transfers

LivePsalms is hosted on cloud infrastructure provided by Supabase, utilizing Amazon Web Services (AWS) data centers. Our primary infrastructure is located in the **United States** [4] [8].

If you access our services from outside the United States — including from the European Economic Area (EEA), the United Kingdom (UK), Switzerland, or any other jurisdiction — your personal data will be transferred to and processed in the United States. We acknowledge that the United States may not provide the same level of data protection as your home jurisdiction.

To ensure that your data receives adequate protection during these international transfers, we implement the following safeguards:

1. **Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs)**: We incorporate the European Commission's Standard Contractual Clauses into our agreements with sub-processors to provide appropriate safeguards for transfers of personal data from the EEA to the United States [4] [5].
2. **Data Processing Agreements (DPAs)**: We maintain formal Data Processing Agreements with all sub-processors that define their obligations regarding data security, confidentiality, and compliance with applicable data protection laws.
3. **Supplementary Measures**: We implement technical measures (encryption, access controls, pseudonymization where feasible) to supplement the contractual safeguards and address any residual risks associated with international transfers.

Our sub-processors' data processing locations are as follows:

| Sub-processor | Data Processing Location | Data Storage Location |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Supabase | AWS region selected at project creation (US by default) | Same as processing region |
| Anthropic | United States, Europe, Asia, Australia (multi-region processing) | United States only [5] |
| Voyage AI | United States | United States |

---

## 8. Data Retention and Deletion

We retain your personal information only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, to comply with our legal obligations, or as permitted by applicable law. We do not retain data indefinitely without purpose.

| Data Category | Retention Period | Deletion Trigger |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Account profile** | Duration of your account | You delete your account from the Profile page. |
| **Notes and folders** | Duration of your account | You delete individual notes/folders, or delete your account (cascading deletion). |
| **Lamplight AI data** | Duration of your account or until you choose to delete it | You click "Forget my Lamplight history" or delete your account. |
| **Newsletter subscription** | Until you unsubscribe | You click the unsubscribe link in any newsletter email. |
| **Avatar image** | Duration of your account | You delete your account (best-effort cleanup from storage). |
| **Browser localStorage** | Until you clear it or migrate to cloud | You clear browser data, use browser storage tools, or migrate data upon account creation. |
| **Authentication session tokens** | Duration of your active session | You sign out or your session expires. |

**Cascading Deletion**: When you delete your account, our system executes a cascading deletion at the database level. Deleting your profile row automatically triggers the permanent deletion of all associated records: notes, folders, Lamplight settings, entitlements, embeddings, artifacts, jobs, suggestions logs, connections, and usage telemetry. This is enforced by foreign key constraints with `ON DELETE CASCADE` at the PostgreSQL level, ensuring no orphaned data remains.

**Backup Retention**: Database backups maintained by our infrastructure provider (Supabase) follow their standard retention schedule. Deleted data will be purged from backup systems within the backup rotation period (typically 7–30 days depending on the plan tier).

Because we do not use non-essential cookies, we do not display a cookie consent banner. All storage mechanisms we use are strictly necessary for the functioning of the service.

---

## 11. Children's Privacy

LivePsalms is not directed at, marketed to, or intended for use by children under the age of 13 (or under the age of 16 in jurisdictions where the GDPR applies and the member state has not lowered the digital age of consent). We do not knowingly collect, solicit, or process personal information from children below these age thresholds.

If we become aware that we have inadvertently collected personal data from a child without verifiable parental consent, we will take immediate steps to delete that information from our systems. If you are a parent or guardian and believe that your child has provided us with personal data without your consent, please contact us immediately at support@livepsalms.com, and we will promptly investigate and remove the data.

We do not use age verification mechanisms at registration. The optional "date of birth" field in the user profile is not used for age-gating purposes and is entirely voluntary.

---

## 12. Third-Party Links and Services

LivePsalms may contain links to third-party websites, services, or resources that are not operated by us. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise you to review the privacy policy of every site you visit.

We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services. Our inclusion of links to third-party resources does not imply endorsement of their privacy practices.

---
